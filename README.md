Javascript DSA programs 

# How to start a DSA program:

1. Understand and restate the problem in your own words
2. Explore concrete Examples
3. Break it down to psuedocode and logical parts
4. Write the code and main logic
5. Refactor and improvize the edge cases with input and special cases

# There are two approaches to solve problems

1. Iterative Approach
2. Recursive Approach

# Dynamic Programming
- Coming up with optimal solutions
- It has two important terms
    1. Overlapping Subproblems
        a. Problem can be broken in subproblems which are repeated in nature
        b. Ex. Fibonacci sequence
    2. Optimal Substructure
        a. 
1. Memoization: Storing the result of expensive function calls and returning cached result when the same input occurs
2. Tabulation:
